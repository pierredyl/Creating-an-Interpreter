# Creating an Interpreter

A lightweight interpreter for a simplified C-like language, written in C++. This project parses, analyzes, and executes C-style code using a custom-built Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and symbol table.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes input source code.
- **Parsing**: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using recursive descent parsing.
- **Symbol Table**: Manages variable declarations and scopes.
- **Interpretation**: Evaluates expressions and executes statements.
- **Control Flow**: Supports `if` and `while` statements.
- **Error Handling**: Provides basic error detection and reporting.
